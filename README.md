# test-google-apps-script
Testing the timeout in Google Apps Script

Google Apps Script documentation says that the maximum execution time allowed is 6 minutes. The true timeout limit seems to be dependent upon your account, potentially whether you have an enterprise Google Workspace account, or other factors. 

This function can be used to test the max timeout in your own Google Apps Script space. 

Just replace the Spreadsheet ID with your own blank spreadsheet.
